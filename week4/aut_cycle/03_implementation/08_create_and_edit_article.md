The purpose of this assignment is to get you familiar with how routes, controllers, and views interact with each other within the context of a rails application.

As such the solution to the create functionality is can be found here in the Rails official guides.

But you need to let your tests guide you with what to do next, this is a very important aspect of the exercise.

Take everything we have done and use that to help you create an edit functionality in your application.
