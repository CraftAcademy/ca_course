This was an important week here at Craft Academy, apart from being introduced to Ruby on Rails we have gone through a lot of theoretical concepts.

Lets do a recap and check off that you have internalized all what we have covered.

- [ ] What migrations are and when we use them
- [ ] What CRUD stands for and what actions are linked to them.
- [ ] What the Model-View-Controller pattern is and how the Ruby on Rails framework is
- [ ] What DRY and Convention Over Configuration means and why we follow these conventions.
