### SlowFood (Sinatra)

**Welcome to the Week 3 of the Bootcamp and the Slow Food Challenge.**

This week we will start with building a web based application using the Sinatra framework. This application will have  limited functionality (see the Requirements section) but will nontheless be a working solution deployed to a server and accessible through the internet.

This week introduces a new set of technologies and skills you'll need as a developer. The objectives for this week is to practice the workflow that we want to use in our projects with focus on:

* Agile methods for software development
* Pair Programming
* Collaboration using Git and GitHub
* Test and Behavior Driven Development

But first things first. Let's start with getting to know Sinatra - and we DON'T mean the famous singer but rather the web framework that bears his name.
