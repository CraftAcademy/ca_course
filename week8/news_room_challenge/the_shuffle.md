## Changes, changes, changes….

*“Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.”* - George Bernard Shaw

Sometimes projects don’t work out as planned - the budget could change, the client might want other features, the communication within the team might be insufficient. That’s exactly where the agile thinking comes in to play! The ability to quickly adapt to changes and deliver solutions to new problems is one of the most important skills in software development.

Your team manager needs to adjust the project to the client's demands. Team members get sick, new competence is needed, priorities change. In order to address the problem, they might have to shuffle your team members around.

### This gives you some great work experience:

- Working with legacy code (code that you have not been involved with before)
- Introducing already existing code to a new member
- Live practice to adapt to new and unexpected situations
- Being a mentor to a new team member
- Practice letting go of an old project which you’re not assigned to any more


For the remainder of the NewsRoom challenge, we will reshuffle the team so that we can practice handling changes in an agile way. The manager needed fresh ideas from developers who haven’t been working on the code, which is why they have decided to keep half the team on and redistribute the rest to the other team. Some team members will change teams and others will remain. This will put you either in a coaching role or in a new member role.

As a junior software developer, you will most likely be introduced to a new team or new team members when you join a company. Adapting to changes is a critical part of your learning experience.

### How to join a new coding team

- Go through the stories in PT
- Read the tests for the software
- Don’t be afraid to let the team members know if you have ideas on how to make the project better, but present them in a respectful manner
- Ask the other team members questions
- Take notes and leverage on your previous experience
- Be honest if you don’t understand and let the other team members know

### How to integrate a new team member

- Demo the application
- Do a dry run of the features
- Be open to possible changes, ideas and code reviews
- Pair up and rotate roles often, so that the new member get to code as well
- You’re a senior at the project, but you’re not a boss - remember to be respectful
- Include the new team member and remember that it’s hard and confusing to join an ongoing project.
