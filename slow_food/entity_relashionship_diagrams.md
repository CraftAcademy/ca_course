## Step 3 - Entity Relationship Diagrams

I want you to draw an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of the system the way you see it fit. ER-modeling is a data modeling technique used in software engineering to produce a conceptual data model of a information system. Diagrams created using this ER-modeling technique are called Entity-Relationship Diagrams, or ER diagrams or ERDs. You can say that **Entity Relationship Diagrams illustrate the logical structure of databases**.

ERD's show entities in a database and relationships between tables within that database. It is essential to have ER-Diagrams if you want to create a good database design. The diagrams help focus on how the database actually works.

There are three basic elements in ER-Diagrams:

* **Entities** are the "things" for which we want to store information. An entity is a person, place, thing or event.
* **Attributes** are the data we want to collect for an entity.
* **Relationships** describe the relations between the entities.
