## Step 3 - Entity Relationship Diagrams
###Databases
A **database** is a collection of information that is organized so that it can easily be accessed, managed, and updated. A **relational database** is a collection of data items organized as a set of formally-described tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables. 

Each table contains data in predefined columns. Each row contains a unique instance of data defined by the columns. For example, a typical business order entry database would include a table that described a customer with columns for name, address, phone number, and so forth. Another table would describe an order: product, customer, date, sales price, etc. 

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a standard interactive and programming language for getting information from and updating a database. Queries take the form of a command language that lets you select, insert, update and delete data.

**ORM (Object-relational mapping)** is a mechanism that makes it possible to address, access and manipulate objects without having to consider how those objects relate to their data sources. Examples of ORM's that we will use during this course are **Data Mapper** and **Active Record**.

**ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)** is a data modeling technique to graphically represent a conceptual data model of a information system. They allow you to display your database structure and show entities and relationships between tables within that database. 

It is essential to have ER-Diagrams if you want to create a good database design. The diagrams help focus on how the database actually works. ER-modeling  You can say that **Entity Relationship Diagrams illustrate the logical structure of databases**.

There are three basic elements in ER-Diagrams:

* **Entities** are the "things" for which we want to store information. An entity is a person, place, thing or event.
* **Attributes** are the data we want to collect for an entity.
* **Relationships** describe the relations between the entities.
