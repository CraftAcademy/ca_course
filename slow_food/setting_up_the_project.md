## Step 1 - Setting up the project


We have set up a repository for the project at https://github.com/CraftAcademy/slow_food_sinatra with some basic functionality regarding user authentication. Your team should make use of that code and pull it in. Fork that repo and go over the code and gems already included in the Gemfile.  Your very fist assignment is the get that code working.  **Make use of all the previous challenges including the Workshop to find answers to obstacles you might encounter.**

**Remember, the code you get to start with is not necessarily right. It is up to you to make this work.**
