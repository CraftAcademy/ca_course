## Step 1 - Setting up the project


We have set up a [repository for the project](https://github.com/CraftAcademy/slow_food_sinatra) with some basic functionality regarding user authentication. Your team should make use of that code and pull it in. Fork that repo and go over the code and the gems already included in the `Gemfile`.  Your very fist assignment is the get that code working. Make use of all the previous challenges to find answers to obstacles you might encounter.

**Remember, as with every other material, there might be errors in the provided code. It's up to you to find and correct them if you choose to use the provided snippets. Don't come blaming the authors of this challenge if you run into trouble ;-)
Finally, itâ€™s not just about the code. This challenge is about practicing the workflow.**


###Agile principles

There are different Agile methodologies you can use in your projects and we will be talking a lot about that and introducing different agile techniques as we move along in the course. For now, you should always follow these core Agile principles:

* focus on user needs
* deliver iteratively
* keep improving how your team works
* fail fast and learn quickly
* keep planning

###Planning your work
Your team should plan together, review these plans regularly and change them based on your progress and any new facts and requirements that arise during the development process. 

We will use 3 types of stories in our project plan: Features, Chores and Bugs

####Features
Features are stories that provide verifiable business value to the team's customer. Examples of features include "add a 'special instructions' field to the checkout page", "purchase history should load in half a second", and "add a new method addToInventory to the public API". Features are worth points and therefore must be estimated

####Chores
Chores are stories that are necessary, but provide no direct, obvious value to the customer. Examples include "sign up for access to geocoding service" and "Find out why the detailed test suite takes so long". Chores can represent "code debt", and/or points of dependency on other teams.

####Bugs
Bugs represent unintended behavior that can be related to features, for example "login box is wrong color", and "price should be non-negative".

Both [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/) and [ZenHub.io](https://www.zenhub.io/) is a project management tools powered by your GitHub Issues & Pull Requests. Waffle.io is the tool of choice for many AgileVentures projects and provides a web based interface for managing Issues and track Pull Requests. ZenHub provides similar functionality (and more) as a browser extension. It is up to you to decide what tool your team want to use.
