## Step 1 - Setting up the project


We have set up a [repository for the project](https://github.com/CraftAcademy/slow_food_sinatra) with some basic functionality regarding user authentication. Your team should make use of that code and pull it in. Fork that repo and go over the code and gems already included in the Gemfile.  Your very fist assignment is the get that code working.  **Make use of all the previous challenges including the Workshop to find answers to obstacles you might encounter.**

**Remember, as with every other material, there might be errors in the provided code. It's up to you to find and correct them if you choose to use the provided snippets. Don't come blaming the authors of this challenge if you run into trouble ;-)
Finally, itâ€™s not just about the code. This challenge is about practicing the workflow.**
