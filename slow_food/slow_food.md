### SlowFood (Sinatra)

Our client is a Restaurant owner that needs an website where he can list his menu and allow visitors to place orders.

#### Scope (v1)

The first version of the application has limited functionality

* The owner need to access a protected part of the application to set up information about his Restaurant and his Menu
* Menu needs to consist of many Dishes
* Each Dish is a Starter, Main course or Dessert
* Visitors of the site can add Dishes to an Order
* Order need to calculate a Total price and a Pick up time (30 minutes)

Nothing else should be considered or implemented.

#### Tools
* Sinatra as web framework
* Foundation6 as CSS framework
* PostgreSQL for database
* Warden for user authentication
* Cucumber for acceptance tests
* RSPec for unit tests


We have set up a repo for the project at https://github.com/CraftAcademy/slow_food_sinatra

Fork that repo and go over the code and gems already included in the Gemfile. Your very fists assignment is the get that code working. **Make use of all the previous challenges including the Workshop to find answers to obstacles you might encounter.**
