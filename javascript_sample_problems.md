# Javascript Sample Problems

  1. Create an array and add three numbers to it.
  2. Use your array to print out the second number.
  3. What data type is `123/12`? `"Things in quotes!"`? `undefined`?
  4. Write a function that checks if a given number is even or odd (use an `if` statement).
  5. Consider this array: `myArray = ['Thomas', 'Amber', 'Raoul']`. Use a `for` loop to print our names in the console. (Hint: `n` needs to be the length of the array. Google a helper method for finding the length of an array in Javascript. Is it the same as Ruby?)
