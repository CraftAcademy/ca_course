## Jasmine - Set up

Jasmine is a Behaviour Driven Development framework for testing JavaScript code. 

[Download Jasmine runner](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases)

Create a project folder for the BMI Challenge and extract the content of the `jasmine-standalone.zip` package to that folder.

The package contains some examples of tests. We will not use those tests but we can have a quick look on how testing with Jasmine is set up by browsing the examples.

From your terminal, open the `SpecRunner.html` file:

```shell
$ open SpecRunner.html
```

That will open the test runner in your default browser and you should see something like this.

Now, let's have a look at the file structure. Open the content of your project folder in your text editor.

```shell
$ atom .
```
