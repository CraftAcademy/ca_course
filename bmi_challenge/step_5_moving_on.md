## Moving on

At this point we will shift gears and allow you to work for yourself. There is plenty of functionality left to implement. 

1. Add a function to calculate BMI using the imerial method.
2. Modify the UI to allow the user to choose between the Metric- and Imperial methods
3. Add some css to the web interface to create a better look and feel of the application
4. Create a local repository and push up your code to GitHub


If you want to find some inspiration you can have a look at a slightly styled version of the BMI Calculator that we have deployed using gh-pages to github.io.
