# The Back-end
We will be using Ruby on Rails as the stack for our back-end.

The challenge is to set up an API-only application that will make it possible to store information about users and their historical data. 

We will be using RSpec as out testing framework and PostgreSQL as out database. 

Before moving on, make sure you scaffold an new Rails application. If you need assistance you can check out the [BDD with Rails](https://craftacademy.gitbooks.io/coding-as-a-craft/content/bdd_with_rails.html) chapter.
