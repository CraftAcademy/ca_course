# The logic - Step 1

Let's start at the unit level. 

```
As an athlete,
In order to get to know my results from the Cooper test
I want to be able to input my distance and get a result from the normative data table
```

We will be doing all calculations on the client side and only save the results to our centralized database (back-end). This means that we will be working defining our logic in JavaScript. This means that we will be using Jasmine for Unit testing. 

As a first step we want to make sure that our units are working. 

Here are the steps you need to complete at this stage:
* Create a new project folder
* Set up Jasmine ([see this section](../bmi_challenge/jasmine_set_up.md)).
* Write a JavaScript program that returns an assessment given the users gender, age and completed distance. Store that program in `cooper.js`
* Make the software accessible in your browsers console
* **You DON'T need to create a UI at this point.**
