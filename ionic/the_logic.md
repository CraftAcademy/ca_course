# The logic
Let's start at the unit level. 

```
As an athlete,
In order to get to know my results from the Cooper test
I want to be able to input my distance and get a result from the normative data table
```

We will be doing all calculations on the client side and only save the results to our centralized database (back-end). his means that we will be working defining our logic in JavaScript. This means that we will be using Jasmine for Unit testing. 

As a first step we want to make sure that our units are working.
