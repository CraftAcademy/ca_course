# The Cooper test challenge
We have an client request to build a mobile fitness tracking application. The idea is that the app will allow users to track their condition using a specific test called [The Cooper Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_test).

The Cooper Test is used to monitor the development of a persons aerobic endurance and to obtain an estimate of their VO2 max.
