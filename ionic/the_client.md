# The Client - Step 3
We will be using Ionic to build our mobile client. If you are not familiar with Ionic yet, please go back in the documentation and complete the [Going mobile with Ionic](https://craftacademy.gitbooks.io/coding-as-a-craft/content/going_mobile_with_ionic.html) chapter.

For this app we will be using the `sidemenu` template. 

Run this command it your terminal to create the application.
```
$ ionic start cooper_client sidemenu
```

`cd` into the new folder (`cooper_client`) and install the `npm` and `bower` dependencies.
```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```
Once that is ready, you might want to start the Ionic server to see if everything is set up correctly.
```
$ ionic serve -c --lab
```
You should see something like this.
