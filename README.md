###Craft Academy Bootcamp
##### Coding as a Craft - in 12 weeks
Craft Academy is a 12-week intensive, practice-oriented camp for aspiring junior developers. It gives you the basics you need to create, develop and launch web-based applications.

This publication contains the course materials used during the on-site delivery. You are free to use it for your personal learning needs, we encourage that. It is how ever not allowed to use the materials in a commercial context. It is not okay and it is against the very meaning of open source. 

This is very much a Work In Progress (WIP) and we will be pushing content regulary. Stay tuned.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at info@makersacademy.se
