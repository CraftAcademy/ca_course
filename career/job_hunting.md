When applying for new jobs your resume and your background will probably fall under three different categories:

- Entry-level (about 0-3 years of experience)
- Career Change
- Industry Experience

This is important as you can narrow down your job search instead of applying for jobs where you would not be a good fit.

Searching for a new job is an exhausting and difficult process but you can alleviate the process by answering two questions:

- What kind of job do I want?
- Understand what the employer wants

### What kind of job do I want?

You should know what you want and try to only search for roles that match those requirements.
This makes it easier for you to find the right jobs and also du weed out the jobs that you don’t want and making sure that you keep focused.

Before you start you job search decide on what you can’t compromise on, some guidelines are:

- The Role

What is the job you want to do vs the job you could do

- Location

Is relocation an option for you?

- The company values

What companies could you work for or absolutely not work for?

#### Understand what the employer wants

It is important to research before you send out an application so that you are sure that you know what the employer wants. Are your qualifications a good match for the company you are applying to or do they use the technologies that you are interested in?

Any employer wants people that meet the qualifications and are passionate about the field the company is in.

##### How do you find out what the company really wants

What countries is the company active in? This means that the company will need someone that are used to work with international teams and that can speak multiple languages.

Go through the companies homepage and write down keywords that you see that gives you more insight on what the company stands for and are looking for. Use the keywords to answer why you want to work for that company before you send out an application.

This gives applicants, without the right background, an edge when applying for jobs.

Let's talk about some general tips for your resume:

#### List your experience
 
Some experiences that are seen as soft skills for example -  good communication skills, great work ethic, good with people etc is something that you should add to your resume, but make sure that you also add a context of when the soft skills had a good impact on your work.

#### Use numbers
Using numbers in your resume when you can. For example:

```
Instead of:
“I managed a team”

You should write:
“I managed a team of 10 people”
```

```
Instead of:
“During my time at the company I managed to increase the sales for two years in a row”

You should write:
“During my time at the company I managed to increase the sales with 20% the first year and 10% the second year”
```

#### Use one page resume

Recruiters often get a lot of resumes. The longer it is the less likely it is for the whole resume to get read. It is a good idea to only use one page resume with good summaries of your experience. The interview is a good time to dive deeper and explain your experience in greater detail. 

#### Layout

Make sure the layout is nice and avoid misalignment so that the recruiter can focus on your skill and experience rather than the formatting errors in your resume. It also shows your attention to details.

If you are more than 70% qualified for the role then you are a good candidate for the job.
