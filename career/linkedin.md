### Why is LinkedIn important?

Recruiters use LinkedIn to connect with candidates. Your CV highlights your career at a glance, LinkedIn paints a portrait of you as a web developer. The LinkedIn’s community is very active, with many contributors, this means that LinkedIn gives you the chance to create a great personal brand


##### Your goals with LinkedIn are to:

- Show up in a search in the recruiter's search result with the right keywords
- Signal that you are qualified and motivated

### Show Up in Search Results

In order to show up in the search results, you need to add the right keywords to your LinkedIn “summary”. The right keywords are often technologies and buzzwords that are commonly used to describe a certain field within technology like “FinTech” or “MedTech” and so on. Add the keyword describing the field that you would like to work in or have experience with. This will make sure that you are found in the recruiter's searches. Do remember to fill in information about your experience in the summary field as well. The summary field is the first thing that the recruiters look at so make sure that you are well presented. Be direct and to the point.

When recruiters do find your profile you need to stand out in the search results. This means that you should have a good headline. The headline is the information visible directly underneath your name in the search results. You should try to add a keyword to your profile page along with the benefit you could provide to a company. Be professional and avoid silly headlines. You want to stand out from the crowd, but for the right reasons.

### Signal that you are qualified for the job

Add your previous work experience even though if it's not directly related to tech. Experience in different fields is a big advantage in many fields, not only tech. Make sure that you point that out in your profile.
Add the certificates and courses you have taken. Make sure that you clarify what you learned during these courses. And how you applied them.

### Make your profile more complete

LinkedIn has a feature that allows you to view the level of completeness of your profile. This means that LinkedIn shows you if there are sections in your profile that you are missing or that you could add more content to. But just in case - make sure that you fill out all the sections in your profile.

### Use a URL

You can use a custom URL that links directly to your profile. This makes it easier for you to add the link to your profile to other website and making it easier for you to remember the URL to your profile if needed.

### Add a profile image

A good idea is to have a profile picture. It is easier for people to connect to you if they have pictures that they can relate to. The picture you are using should of course be a professional one. Images that could be perceived as funny should probably be in your other social media accounts. A good idea is to have a headshot or perhaps a picture where you are working.

### Use Multimedia in your profile

Link to your Github page, add links and images of your certificates and make sure that you add any videos of you coding on different projects, presentations, and slides. These make you stand out from the crowd.

### Many connections

Try to add connections each month. This is really important because it shows that you can network and on the other hand the bigger your network the easier it is for you to find a job if someone in your network is looking for a developer. Remember that companies often look through their own network for potential candidates before they actually create a job posting or ask recruiters to find developers. However, do not add random people you don't know as this could get your account shut down by LinkedIn.

### Some final words

Update your LinkedIn profile on a regular basis. Make sure that you keep it professional and that you showcase your experience in a good way. The next step for you should be to follow companies and organizations and to start networking with people that you think would be good for your personal brand.
