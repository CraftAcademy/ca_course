## Why is LinkedIn important?

Recruiters use LinkedIn to connect with candidates. Your CV highlights your career at a glance, LinkedIn paints a portrait of you as a web developer. The LinkedIn’s community is very active, with many contributors, this means that  LinkedIn gives you the chance to create a great personal brand 

### Setting up your LinkedIn account
There are 3 important points you want to keep in mind when setting up your profile.

##### Your goals with LinkedIn are to:

- Show up in a search in the recruiters search result with the right keywords
- Signal that you are qualified and motivated

### Show Up in Search Results

In order to show up in the search results you need to add the right keywords to your LinkedIn “summary”. The right keywords are often technologies and buzzwords that are commonly used to describe a certain field within technology like “FinTech” or “MedTech” and so on. Add the keyword describing the field that you would like to work in or have experience with.  This will make sure that you are found in the recruiters searches. Do remember to fill in information about your experience in the summary field as well. The summary field is is the first thing that the recruiters look at so make sure that you are well presented. Be direct and to the point. 

When recruiters do find your profile you need to stand out in the search results. This means that you should have a good headline. The headline is the information visible directly underneath your name in the search results.  You should try to add a keyword in your profile page along with the benefit you could provide to a company. Be professional and avoid silly headlines. You want to stand out from the crowd, but for the right reasons.

### Signal that you are qualified for the job

Add your previous work experience even though if its not directly related to tech. Experience in different fields is a big advantage in many fields, not only tech. Make sure that you point that out in your profile.
Add the certificates and and courses you have taken. Make sure that you clarify what you learned during these courses. And how you applied them. 


### Some final words

Update your LinkedIn profile on a regular basis. Make sure that you keep it professional and that you showcase your experience in a good way.  The next step for you should be to follow companies and organizations and to start networking with people that you think would be good for your personal brand.
