## What is Sinatra?

Sinatra is a **framework** for building web aplications. A web application framework is a set of tools designed to support the development of dynamic websites, web applications, web services and web resources. A framework aims to alleviate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development.

We will be using a lot of frameworks during the bootcamp - each one with a specific purpose, way of doing things, and advantages for you as a developer to benefit from. 

You might ask yourself which framework is the best? The one with the largest user base, with the most plugins, the one that grings a lot of "magic" to the table or the one that lets you, the developer, to make all the dicisions about implementation and structure of your application? Some web frameworks come prepackaged with files, folders, ways for you to easily get started right away.  Other web frameworks do not. 

A lot happens in the software development world and there is no definite answer on what framework is the best one. It all depends on what sort of application you are setting out to build and what features you are going to implement. When I choose a framework I look at certain characteristics in order to form an opinion and make an informed choice: 
* Simplicity to learn
* Volume of external resources
* Versatility
* Browser support 
* Accessibility

This is not a time nor place to have a deeper discussions of all the various web application frameworks out there. The objective should be to understand the concepts of what happens in an application (What is a request to a server? What do the server respond with? How is tha data needed to create an reponse structured, stored and accessed? Etc). Keep in mind that once you learn one specific framework, itâ€™s usually fairly easy to learn a new one. 

**We've chosen the Sinatra framework as the first one to introduce to you in this bootcamp. In our opinion Sinatra is rather simple to learn, it has a quite remarkable amount of libraries (ruby gems) you can leverage on while building your application, it's a good choice for basic information systems and rather accessible in terms of documentation and support.**
