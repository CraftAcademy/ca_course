## Working in the Cloud

You can go through the entire course using a service such as [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) or [Koding](https://koding.com/). Using any of these services means you get access to a system “in the cloud” that you can reach from your web browser. You can access the hosted development environment from any computer that is connected to the internet. 

Both Cloud9 and Koding have free plans and both allow several developers to collaborate and share code. Another handy service you can use to share code (but not execute it) is [Kobra.io](https://kobra.io) that also comes with handy video chat.
