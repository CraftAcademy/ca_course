# Javascript Exercises #1

  1. Create an array and add three numbers to it.
  2. Use your array to return the second number.
  3. What data type is `123/12`? `"Things in quotes!"`? `undefined`?
  4. Write an `if` statement that returns true.
  5. Consider these two arrays: `myArray = ['Thomas', 'Amber', 'Raoul']` and `emptyArray = []`. Use a `for` loop to add our names to `emptyArray`. (Hint: `n` needs to be the length of the array. Google a helper method for finding the length of an array in Javascript. Is it the same as Ruby?)
