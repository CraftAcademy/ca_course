## npm & NodeJS

`npm` is the default package manager for the JavaScript. 
`npm` comes preinstalled with Node. ** *We will not be covering NodeJS in this chapter, but will do so further down the road in this course. * **

If you have Node, you already have npm! If not, install Node - it's as easy as downloading and then running an installer.

Visit the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) website and download the installer.

Once your download is completed, run the installer and follow that instructions.
