## npm & NodeJS

`npm`, short for Node Package Manager, is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management. 

`npm` comes preinstalled with Node. ** *We will not be covering NodeJS in this chapter, but will do so further down the road in this course. * **

If you have Node, you already have npm! If not, install Node - it's as easy as downloading and then running an installer.

Visit the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) website and download the installer.

Once your download is completed, run the installer and follow that instructions.

You can check your version by going to your terminal and typing in this command 
```bash
$ node -v
```
