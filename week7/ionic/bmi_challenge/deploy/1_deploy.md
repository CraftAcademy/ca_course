There are plenty of other little things you can do in order to update the UI and add functionality to this little application.

One final thing before we call it quits is to publish your app to [Ionic View](https://ionicframework.com/pro/view).

Head over to the Ionic platform [signup](https://dashboard.ionicframework.com/signup) page to get signed up and to get your Ionic ID.

In your project folder, run the following command:

```shell
$ ionic upload
```

You will be prompted for your `username` and `password` (the one you received when you signed up). Once this is done, your app will be uploaded to the Ionic platform.

Once this is finished, you will receive output like the following:

```shell
Uploading App...
App Uploaded (xxxxxxx) #that will be your application code
```

Once this message is shown, your app has been uploaded to the Ionic platform and ready to go.

If you want to view your Ionic App on an iOS or Android device you need to install the ‘Ionic View’ app from the App Store/Google Play. Log in with your credentials. Once logged in, you should see your uploaded app

In order to share your Ionic app with your friends share the app number with them and ask them to download the Ionic View app. If they input that number in the Ionic View app they will be given access to your app.
