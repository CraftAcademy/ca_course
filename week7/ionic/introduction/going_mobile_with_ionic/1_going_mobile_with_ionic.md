**We are spending more time online than with any other media and much of that digital time is spent on mobile devices. Most of that time is spent in apps rather than in the mobile browser.**

But hold on! My website is responsive, so why do I need a mobile App?

Responsive web design is just one part of a complete mobile strategy. Responsive designed sites ensure that no matter which device is being used, visitors are met with a usable experience. Native apps, on the other hand, take the mobile experience to the next level. At their best, they do more than just repackage existing content and functionality; they also present navigation, content, and functionality in a way specifically optimized for the measurably different ways in which people actually use their mobile devices.
