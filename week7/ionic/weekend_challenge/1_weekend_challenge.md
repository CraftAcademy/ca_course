## Testing Ionic Application
### Week 7 

### Instructions

This weekend challenge will be about testing the BMI challenge you did earlier this week.

* Challenge time: this weekend, until Monday 9am
* Feel free to use Google, Stack Overflow, your notes, previously written code, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to or have in whole or partially used the solution of a coach or another student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution to GitHub**
* You must submit your repo in the submission channel by 9.00am Monday morning - before the stand-up


### Learning objective

How to write unit and e2e tests in Ionic.

###Tasks

* Setting up a test environment in Ionic
* E2E testing using Protractor
* Unit testing using Jasmine and Karma


###Tips
* [Jasmine cheat sheet](https://devhints.io/jasmine)
* [Official jasmine documentations](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html)
* [Protractor cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/javierarques/0c4c817d6c77b0877fda)
* [Protractor documentation using locators](https://www.protractortest.org/#/locators)


#####I'm hoping to see that:
* You can take a problem set and write a well tested implementation on your own.
* You know how to write specs and use them as a blueprint in your development.
* I can track your work by following you commit history - so please commit as soon you are done with a feature or when you have made a test pass. 

#####In your repo, I'm hoping to see:
* That you are testing the right thing in the right spec file.
* That all tests passing - green is good!
* High test coverage (above 85% is accepted)


**Happy coding!**
