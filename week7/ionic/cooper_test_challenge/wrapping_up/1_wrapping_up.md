What we have focused on is the most basic functions and connecting the client to the back-end API. As with all walk-throughs in this book, there's plenty of functionality you can add to this app to make the user experience much better.

Some suggestions as to what to do next:

- More user management functions
	- Register
	- Update account, etc
	- OAuth login (Facebook, Twitter)
- UI enhancements
	- Colors
	- Backgrounds
	- Display current user profile name in side menu
- Functionality
	- Calculate VO2-max
	- Add the BMI calculator
	- Add local storage for better performance (no internet connection)
- Resources
	- Generate icons and a splash screen.
	
**There's plenty of possibilities!**
