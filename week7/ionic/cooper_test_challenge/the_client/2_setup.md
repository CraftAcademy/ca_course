Last time we generated a new ionic application using the tabs menu, let's do something different this time. For this app, we will be using the sidemenu template.

Run this command in your terminal to create the application.
```shell
$ ionic start cooper_client sidemenu
```
Navigate to the new folder (cooper_client) and let's start the application to see what it looks like.
```shell
$ ionic serve --lab
```
If you see something that looks like this, congratulations, you have just generated your second ionic application.
