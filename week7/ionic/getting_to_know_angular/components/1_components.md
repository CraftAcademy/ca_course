Components control a section of the whole page that the user sees, so let's put this into context. Go ahead and have a look at the YouTube screenshot below:

From the screenshot above we can see that we can structure the page in different sections:

1. A section for playing the video
2. A section containing video description
3. section for adding a comment and displaying comments
4. section for suggesting other videos

Each of the sections is modeled as single components that are stitched together to make up the whole page.
