Ensure you have NodeJS installed on your system by:
```shell
$ node --version
```
Install the angular cli using npm or yarn
```shell
$ npm i -g @angular/cli
# or
$ yarn global add @angular/cli
```
cd into the right directory then run the following command to generate our new angular application

```shell
$ ng new new-app
```
This will generate a new angular application called new-app, give it time to
install various libraries it will need then cd into the application
```shell
$ cd new-app
```
We can run our server to see how it looks like
```shell
$ ng serve
```
Navigate to http://localhost:4200
