Services are everything that can act as a data source. For now let's simplify the definition of services to 'the section of an app which is able to give us data that we can use'. The source is in most cases an external API.

Services are also able to validate user input as when the user types it in. The example below shows how the user is denied to use a certain username that is already taken (yes there are typos in the first screen where a 'C' and a 'T' are missing).
