Let's generate a component called comment:

```shel
$ ng generate component comment
# or a shorter version
$ ng g c comment
```
From the files we have just generated, let's identify what we have learned so far:

 - Where in the file structure is the component file located?
 - What is the decorator, and what information does the decorator have?
 - Where is the template file located? Now add a paragraph with your name in the template
 - How do we add our component to a view?
 - Can we add our component to the index file?
 - Is it possible to add the component to the `app.component.html` file?
