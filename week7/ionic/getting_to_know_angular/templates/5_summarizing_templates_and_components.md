Have a look at the diagram below, we have our root component with respective root template file. This is where all the other components are inserted as you can see `child component` A and `child component` B are both on the `root component`.` Child A component` has another component in it, we can refer to this as a `grandchild component` since we are inserting it in the `child componen`t.
