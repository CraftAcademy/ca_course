Angular is a framework for building dynamic web applications - often referred to as a single-page applications (SPA). It lets you use HTML as your template language and extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components. Angular is added to an HTML page with a <script> tag.

Angular extends HTML attributes with Directives and binds data to HTML with Expressions. Data binding is an automatic way of updating the view whenever the model changes, as well as updating the model whenever the view changes.

The purpose of this chapter is to give you a basic understanding of the framework and provide you with a foundation to move on to more advanced techniques when working with Ionic.
