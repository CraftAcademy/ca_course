# Step 1 - The logic

In the interest of giving you more time to work on the ionic application, we'll provide you with an implementation of the Cooper Logic in TypeScript. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/CraftAcademy/ts-cooper). We will use this code at a later stage when building the mobile application. Spend some time (at least 15-30mins) going over the tests and implementation files on that repository. To familiarize yourself with it. If something isn't clear to you, pull a coach in a session to walk you through the code.



If you're interested in building this yourself as a personal challenge (in Javascript), below are the instructions for doing that. **But note that this should be done in your personal time.** For now read through the code provided to you and move on to the next step.
