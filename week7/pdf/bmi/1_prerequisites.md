During the prep-course, you worked on a small web application to practice JavaScript, the BMI Calculator. This week we will build a mobile version of that application. Before we get started on that, let's make sure we have everything we need setup on our computer.

### Node.js
To check your version of node run

```shell
$ node -v
v8.1.2 # Might be a different version on your system
```

### Ionic and Cordova

Install the latest `Cordova` and `Ionic` command-line tools.

```shell
$ npm install -g cordova ionic
```

iOS development requires iOS simulator which you can install with

```shell
$ npm -g install ios-sim
```

Better yet, you should make sure that you have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed on your system.

Good stuff. You are ready to start your project.
