## Style ReactJS Application

### Week 7

### Instructions

This weekend challenge will be about styling the user saved entries in the Cooper challenge.
Currently we are only displaying a long ugly list of entries that we want to style and make it more presentable using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)

- Challenge time: this weekend, until Monday 9am
- Feel free to use Google, Stack Overflow, your notes, previously written code, books, etc. but work on your own
- If you refer to or have in whole or partially used the solution of a coach or another student, please put a link to that in your README
- If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution to GitHub**
- You must submit your repo in the submission channel by 9.00am Monday morning - before the stand-up
