# Visual Studio Code

### Introduction
In this guide we will give a short introduction to the IDE Visual Studio Code (VSC for short). VSC Is developed and maintained by the people of Microsoft. 

VSC is a source code editor, this means that it is specifically designed to edit source code for computer programs by programmers. 

You can use VSC for the most popular operating system  like Windows, OSX and Linux.

### Features

Some of the features that VSC comes with are:

- Support for debugging
- Embedded Git control
- Syntax highlighting
- Code completion
- Code refactoring

These features will help us alot in our efforts to create beautiful and funtional code. 

### Getting started

#### 1) **Download and install**

Go over to the VSC [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the version you need depending on your operating system.

 Follow the instructions and install the VSC editor

#### 2) **Customize the editor**

Change the color theme to a dark theme. This will make it a lot easier to read your code, and also make it easier on your eyes, especially when working long hours in front of the monitor. 

**Go to:**
 **Code**  >  **Preferences**  >  **Color Themes** and choose a dark theme.


#### 3) **Add extensions**

Extensions is a powerful way for us to add functionality to the VSC editor. These extensions will give us ability to use features depending on what programming language or framework we are using. Add extensions when you need them. 

For example if we will start using the Ruby Programming language, in that case we would like an extension that will help our coding to be quicker and with less bugs from syntax. The simplest solution to this is to download an extension from the VSC marketplace. 

You can browse and install extensions from within VS Code. Bring up the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the  **Activity Bar**  on the side of VS Code or the  **View: Extensions**  command (⇧⌘X).
