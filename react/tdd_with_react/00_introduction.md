# Preamble
Software testing plays an important role in the process of verifying software functionality and preventing bugs in production code. By writing automated tests using code instead of conducting manual tests, the
amount of tedious work during the development process can be reduced and the software quality can be improved.

Software testing is a process used for increasing the quality of a software or a product and for improving it by identifying defects, problems, and errors. It is considered by many as the most important phase of the whole process of software development.

There are many different types of testing that you can use to make sure that changes to your code are working as expected. We will be going over the concepts in more details, exploring the pros and cons of them,  before we start practicing some of them.

# Manual vs. Automated testing

At a high level, we need to make the distinction between manual and automated tests. Manual testing is done in person, by clicking through the application or interacting with the software and APIs with the appropriate tooling. This is very expensive as it requires someone to set up an environment and execute the tests themselves, and it can be prone to human error as the tester might make typos or omit steps in the test script.

Automated tests, on the other hand, are performed by a machine that executes a test script that has been written in advance. These tests can vary a lot in complexity, from checking a single method in a class to making sure that performing a sequence of complex actions in the UI leads to the same results. It's much more robust and reliable than automated tests â€“ but the quality of your automated tests depends on how well your test scripts have been written.

Automated testing is a key component of concepts like Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery and it's a great way to scale the QA process.
