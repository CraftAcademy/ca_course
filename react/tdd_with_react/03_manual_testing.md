# Are Manual Test Not Needed?

Manual testing provides a way to quickly evaluate a product and provide testers with a familiarity of the features during the development process. Testers create test cases based on their ability to determine whether or not requirements are met. But initially these test cases have to be executed manually, both for the sake of verification of the necessary steps, and also in order to record test scripts for automation in the future.

Advantages of Manual Testing

1) **Programming Knowledge is not required**

In Manual Testing, Understanding Requirements, Documenting Test Cases and Executing Test Cases are the important tasks, but Programming is not used.If it is Test Automation every tool uses anyone Programming language to enhance test cases, so programming knowledge is mandatory for Test Automation.

2) **Recommendable for Dynamically changing GUI designs**

If the User Interface of the application changes dynamically then test automation is not recommendable.

3) **Manually Testing Tests From a Human Perspective**

Human testers can quickly identify when something looks "off". Automated tests don’t pick up these visual issues. When a tester interacts with software as a user would, they’re able to discover usability issues and user interface glitches. Automated tests can’t test for these things. 

4) Exploratory Testing Can Only Be Done Manually

Automated tests only perform the actions that you tell them to. They require planning and preparation to write, which restricts the test to certain boundaries. These boundaries mean there isn’t any room to stray from the written test to truly “explore” the application. Exploratory testing (or adhoc testing) gives us the opportunity to answer questions like, “what happens if I do this?” It enables us to carve our own path throughout the test with little to no boundaries.

5) Automated Tests Can Contain Errors and Holes

Just like code can have bugs, automated test scripts can also have bugs. This means that automated testing has the potential to report false positives and false negatives. By including a human touch throughout the testing process, these errors are avoided.

6) Some Scenarios Are Not Technically Feasible to Automate or Cost Too Much

Let’s take, for example, an iPad app that relies heavily on tap gestures. Automating the “tap” can not only be costly but also may not be the most accurate test compared to a human’s finger touching the user interface. It often makes more sense to manually test certain features. By the time you find a resource to write an automated test, a manual test could be completed with bugs already fixed. Sometimes, it makes more sense to just go the “manual” route.

7) Manual Testing Helps Us Understand the Whole Problem

Over time, automated testing can save time. It is great for getting quick results on a broad level, but manual testing allows us to understand the problem on a conceptual and emotional level. It connects us with the end-user and introduces us to a level of empathy automated testing doesn’t provide.
