## Working with Legacy Code

###Your assignment
You are assigned by your Project Manager to work on an application that is totally undocumented and not actively maintained. Your and your teammates task is to get the code base, deploy it to a staging server and get it to a state where adding new functionality is possible. 

A big part of your work will be to cover the application with tests. 
1. Write Acceptance tests for the entire workflow using either RSpec OR Cucumber
2. Write Unit tests for the models using RSpec
3. Set up an automated way of deploying the software. 

You are asked to use a service of your choice in order to get  metrics on how well the code is tested. 

You are free to use any service you want in order to document your work.
