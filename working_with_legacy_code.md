## Working with Legacy Code
This week is all about Rails and legacy code! Working with largely untested legacy code base is a quite common situation you'll might find yourself in as a junior developer - so grasping the skills needed to get to know an existing code base, write new tests and perform refactoring will make your life much easier in the future.


From our perspective we feel that throwing you out on deep waters is challenging way to introduce you to a new framework, but it is a method that will give you a solid foundation to build upon when it is time to move ahead and build your own applications.

Happy coding!

###Your assignment
You are assigned by your Project Manager to work on an application that is totally undocumented and not actively maintained. Your and your teammates task is to get the code base, deploy it to a staging server and get it to a state where adding new functionality is possible. 

A big part of your work will be to cover the application with tests. 
1. Write Acceptance tests for the entire workflow using either RSpec OR Cucumber
2. Write Unit tests for the models using RSpec
3. Set up an automated way of deploying the software. 

You are asked to use a service of your choice in order to get  metrics on how well the code is tested. 

You are free to use any service you want in order to document your work.

###Objective
**The main objective for this challenge is to practice the workflow that we want to use in our projects with focus on:**

1. **Agile methods for software development**  
2. **Pair Programming**  
3. **Collaboration using Git and GitHub**  
4. **Test- and Behavior Driven Development**  

Also, setting up a tool that allows you to plan your work ([Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/) or [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/)) in this projects is not a bad idea. 

This is a non-trivial application and even if the gems we will be using will provide most of the functionality we will need, it is still a hard challenge. The only way you will succeed is if you pay close attention to details and focus on the right tasks in the right time.

At some point during this week you will be asked to explain your workflow to the coaches. We will evaluate each and every commit you make to GitHub and we will pay close attention to the sequence in which you do things. 

Documenting all aspects of your application in your README file is, of course, important.  
 
**As with every other material, there might be errors in the provided code. It's up to you to find and correct them.**

**Finally, remember, Itâ€™s not just about the code. This challenge is about practicing the workflow.**
