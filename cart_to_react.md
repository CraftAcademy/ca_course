## Adding cart functionality to React

In this section we are going to add checkout functionality to our react application. 
The prerequsitet for this functionality is that we have products on our page that are ready to sell. 

Start with making sure that you have the latest code pulled from github on your development branch and create a new branch called `add_order_functionality` or something that you think is appropriate to the user story.

As always we will work in a test driven way. Making sure that we let our acceptance test guide our development. This will ensure us that we are not biting off more than we can chew. But also that we stay in scope.


Create a new feature file by typing  
`$ touch cypress/integration/userCanAddProductsToOrder.feature.js`

Add the following tests to the file:

```js
describe("User can add a product to their order", () => {
  before(() => {
    cy.server();
    cy.route({
      method: "GET",
      url: "http://localhost:3000/api/products",
      response: "fixture:product_data.json"
    });
    
    cy.route({
      method: "POST",
      url: "http://localhost:3000/api/orders",
      response: { message: "A product has been added to your order" }
    });
  });
  
  it("user gests a confirmation messsage when adding a a prodcut to order", () => {
    cy.visit("http://localhost:3001"); // Make sure to point it to port 3001 as we are using 3000 for our API
    cy.get("#product-1").within(() => {
      cy.get("#button")
        .contains("Add to order")
        .click();
    });
    cy.wait(3000)
  });
});

```
