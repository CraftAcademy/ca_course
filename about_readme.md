# About README's
It is important to ensure that the projects README includes correct and relevant information that will allow a new developer to get the necessary insights about your project in order to use and understand the application. 

With a comprehensive, well-written README any developer should be able to hop on to your project and begin writing code within 10 minutes. If you consider that over the course of developing an app you'll likely see multiple developers set up the app multiple times, you'll cumulatively save hours of developer time with just minutes of work.


#### General Information

The **General Information** section should give a new developer an idea of what the project is about and who is involved with it.

Information you might want to include is:

* The name of the project
* The name and contact details of the client and any 3rd party vendors as well as names of the developers on the project
* A brief description of the project that provides the answer to the most important question of them all: **“What problem is this project solving?”**
* An outline of the technologies in the project.programming language, frameworks, important gems, database, ORM, etc.
* Links to any related projects
* Links to online tools related to the application (e.g.: Links to the CI server, Pivotal Tracker or Waffle board, development and staging servers, the production site, etc.  

#### Getting Started

The **Getting Started** section outlines the process of getting the app installed for a new developer. 

Information you might want to include is:

* A detailed spin-up process. This should include:
  * Instructions on installing any software and/or gems the application is dependent on.
  * Detailed instructions on running the app (with step-by-step commands needed to get up and running on a local machine)  
  * A list of settings that need to be configured (for third party API's) 
  * A list of seeded credentials that can be used to log in with each user type in the system
  * Any information about subdomains in the app (e.g.: api.myapp.dev/)
  * 
A good tip is to When writing instructions pretend you’re writing them for someone who knows next to nothing about developing in the framework/language your application uses.

#### Testing

The **Testing** section need to include  the commands to run any of the test suites you have (RSpec, Jasmine, Cucumber) and any setup you need to do before-hand 

#### Deployment
The Deployment section should include any information needed to deploy the application to a remote server.

**Note that README files are most commonly written in Markdown - a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax to style text on the web. Mastering Markdown is easy but do give [this Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) a read. **
