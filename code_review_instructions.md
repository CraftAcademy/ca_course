## Code Review Instructions
Performing a Peer Review is a good way to enhance your own learning. 

We have put together a set of common issues that you might find useful in the process of doing a code review (You might also want to use this checklist on your own code at times).

### The README
It is important to ensure that the projects README includes correct and relevant information that will allow a new developer to get the necessary insights about your project in order to use and understand the application. 

**In our code reviews we want to pay attention to a well written and structured README. ** Please follow this guide for how to structure a good README while performing your code review.

### The Setup
Checkout the code follow the setup instructions. What you want to be looking for is:
* Are the setup instructions in the README correct?
* Are there any pitfalls in the set up process? 

### The Tests
Once you are set up with the application, run all automated tests. 

What you want to be looking for is:
* Are the tests passing after a vanilla install? 
* Is there any test coverage metrics? How much of the code is covered in tests? 

### The Functionality
Read the code and try and use the app through the web interface if there is one, or load the code in the console (IRB or Rails console) and experiment with it. 

What you want to be looking for is:
* Is the application behaving the way it is intended? 
* Are there any outstanding functions that are still not been implemented? 

### The Code
Now, go over the code and ...
