# React Native

React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android. It’s based on React, Facebook’s JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms. In other words: web developers can now write mobile applications that look and feel truly “native”. Plus, because most of the code you write can be shared between platforms, React Native makes it easy to simultaneously develop for both Android and iOS.

### Installation

We will be using Expo to build and our application and I will quote their documentation for introduction

> The fastest way to build an app
> With Expo tools, services, and React Native, you can build, deploy, and quickly iterate on native iOS and Android apps from the same JavaScript codebase.
>
> - Access to device capabilities like camera, location, notifications, sensors, haptics, and much more, all with cross-platform APIs.
> - Build service gives you app-store ready binaries and handles certificates, no need for you to touch Xcode or Android Studio.
> - Over-the-air updates let you update your app at any time without the hassle and delays of submitting to the store.

#### Mac

```sh
$ npm install -g expo-cli
```

#### iOS simulator

Install [Xcode through the Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835). It'll take a while, go have a nap. Next, open up Xcode, go to preferences and click the Components tab, install a simulator from the list.

#### Ubuntu

```sh
$ npm install -g expo-cli
```

#### Android Studio

The installation for Android Studio is lengthy one and you have to make sure you do everything required to install it. **Do Not Skip Any Steps**

Visit this [page](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) and select `React Native Cli Quickstart` - Development OS: `Linux` - Target OS: `Android`
