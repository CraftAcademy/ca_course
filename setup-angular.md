## Installing angular cli

Ensure you have nodejs installed in  your system by:

```shell
$ node --version
```

Install the angular cli using `npm` or `yarn`

```shell
$ npm i -g @angular/cli
# or
$ yarn global add @angular/cli
```

cd into the right directory then run the following command to generate our  
new angular application

```shell
$ ng new new-app
```

This will generate a new anglar application called `new-app`, give it time to  
install various libararies it will need then cd into the application

```shell
$ cd new-app
```

We can run our server to see how it looks like

```shell
$ ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/.`

Thats all for this section, you should be able to see a web page at that url.



Next step is to get some basics on javascript modules, moving on.....
