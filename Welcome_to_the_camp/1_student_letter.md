Dear Craft Academy Student,

Big congratulations for joining the course. We really look forward to helping you find your way as a developer. You will learn a lot, make new friends, be challenged and engaged - your life will be turned upside down. A smart move.

This letter is intended to let you know what we expect of you during your 12 weeks at Craft Academy - and what to expect of yourself. We will also share with you some thoughts about who we are, how we work and what you can expect from us in return.

Please read this letter carefully to ensure that you understand what you have gotten yourself into and what mindset we want you to have with you when you step through our doors.

Craft Academy was founded to help people change career and move in to the world of web development. We do not work in education for education's sake. We work on training you to become  a junior developer and build projects in the real world.


#### LEARNING THE CRAFT ACADEMY WAY

Our course is unique, not only in intensity but also in approach.

Your experience at Craft Academy will be very different from the time you have spent with 'traditional' education: school, high school or university. We will have demos introducing new concepts on a regular basis, we also provide you with projects, exercises and weekend challenges. But you are expected to chase knowledge and experience on your own at certain times. 

**Why?**

We believe that traditional education teaches people to pass tests rather than learning. It is just as important that you are here to learn as it is that we are here to teach you. And how much you learn will always be up to you. 

We will not review your code as if it were homework; we will be here to show and guide you to improve. Your fellow students and seniors will help you learn things as much as your instructors.


#### WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS COURSE

We have no magic wand that can make you in to a developer. Along with a positive attitude, hard work is what will make the difference between success and failure.

You will learn to adapt to changes during the course, technology is always changing rapidly just like our content and our curriculum. You will learn to be proactive and make sure that you ask for help when you need it. You will learn how to pair-program with teammates, not only to learn a useful new skill but also to develop your ability to communicate about the code that is being written and to help your teammates to learn.

Instead of being 'taught' you will teach yourself. Success for us as a company means that you achieve your personal goals and become as attractive to potential employers as possible. 

Obviously, we cannot guarantee you a job. None of us knows what will happen during the 12 weeks. You may love or hate the software. When it comes down to it, your chances of getting a job are based on your efforts and how far you can get in 12 weeks - so make the most out of it. 


#### OPENNESS, FEEDBACK AND IMPROVEMENT

Most businesses do not have an open communication policy and do not allow anyone to know other people's actions.

Craft Academy’s team has a policy of extreme openness. It is not always nice, but it is certainly effective. If we talk about another staff member, then they should be included in that conversation. If we are concerned about why something is done, then it is our job to bring it up and question it. No one is above being questioned. No one is too inexperienced or new to challenge anyone in their reasoning or actions.

**We do it.**

The whole team will take note of your feedback and we sit regularly with students individually to talk face to face. Every two weeks we will hold a group meeting, retrospective, to discuss how the course is going and what improvements can be made to have a more successful bootcamp. Your feedback is mandatory – everyone needs to have an opinion in their own success and learning. Otherwise you are just going to waste your own time. 

The most important thing is that we trust that if you have any problems with the course you will know that it is your responsibility to share it with us. Then it's up to us to listen to your opinions and give you answers. Good Luck!


#### Some words of wisdom from our Bootcamp graduates


>“Don't expect to learn "by rote" - you will need to find the answers for yourself - this mirrors real life”

>“This is a bootcamp. Period. Tell your friends and family you will be "off limits" for 3 months. If you aren't prepared to work 7 days a week (including evenings), then this isn't the course for you. Sure, you may get to the end, but you will severely miss out on everything the course has to offer”

>“If you just want to learn to code then this is not the course for you. If you want to learn to be a developer with all it entails, then it almost certainly will be.”

>“Be prepared to collaborate. At Craft Academy, nothing is a solo sport. If you can't/won't work with others then this either isn't for you or, hopefully, this is an opportunity to learn that skill.”

>“Just remember that in the end it is you that will have to do the heavy lifting. Coaching only gets you so far.”

>“For my part I was able to land a job at a company as a frontend developer before I even finished the camp. Just make sure to work hard and diligently, and update your portfolio as you go along.”

>“The tempo is obviously very high and at times it might feel a bit overwhelming with all the new stuff you are constantly being fed, but in the end you will notice how incredibly much you learnt. Really go for it wholeheartedly and it will feel fun rather than tough.”
