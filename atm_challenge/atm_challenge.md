## Ruby basics - ATM Challenge

### Learning experience
- Learn about Ruby classes, modules and methods
- Learn about unit testing with Rspec
- Learn how to use `push` and `pop` on an `Array` object
- Learn about naming standards

### The challenge
Our client is a financial institution that wants to allow its customers to withdraw funds from their accounts using an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM). They have turned to us for a prototype of a system with limited functionality. Our job is to write a simple Ruby program that can be run in the Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB).

### Scope
The following objectives must be met:
- An ATM machine can hold up to $1000
- Withdrawal can be cleared only if the person attempting the withdrawal has sufficient funds on his account
- There are only $10-bills in the ATM. Withdrawals for amouts not divisible by 10 must be rejected.

## Tips and Tricks

- Don't overdo it. Keep your implementation as simple as possible.
- Test your code - both manually in IRB but, most importantly with automated tests.
- Try to write tests ** *before* ** you write your production code. See tests as a blueprint for your implementation.
