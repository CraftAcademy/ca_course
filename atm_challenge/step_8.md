## Step 8 - The Account

Now that we are finished (at least for now) with the Atm class, we should move forward and create the `Account` class. 

We will go over the same steps as we did when creating the `Atm` class. 

1. create a test file (`account_spec.rb`) and
2. create a implementation file (`account.rb`)

In the spec file we'll be writing our spec for code that we are planning to implement. As usual there are decisions about what attributes to add to the class and what methods needs to be defined.

Fortunately, we've already have much of the necessary  
information about that class to make those decisions easier. 

Remember the `class_double` we used while testing the `Atm`'s functionality?
