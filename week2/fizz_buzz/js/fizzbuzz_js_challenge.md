## FizzBuzz Challenge
Do you remember the Fizz Buzz game we were working on in the Prep-course? First time around, we wrote the program using Ruby. Let's do it in JavaScript and implement a web interface using HTML and jQuery.

*- Will this Fizz Buzz bulls^^t ever end?*, you ask yourself. Well, the Fizz Buzz kata is a very common programming challenge when learning a new language. It's a kind of "Hello World" program, but slightly more advanced. 

**The idea with this challenge is that since you have written this code in Ruby, you'll be able to spot both similarities and differences the JavaScript implementation compared to Ruby.**

### Week 2 JavaScript/Jasmine challenge
**To successfully complete the challenge, We want you to deploy it using GitHub pages (also something we've done during the Prep-course, remember?)**

We have prepared this repository for you with all the necessary tools in terms of a testing framework, the  basic folder structure, some spec files, etc.  What you need to do it to make it all work together.

### Instructions
Read this entire README carefully and follow all instructions.
- Challenge time: this weekend, until Monday 9am
- Feel free to use Google, Stack Overflow, your notes, previously written code, books, etc. but work on your own
- If you refer to or have in whole or partially used the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
- If you have a partial solution, **push up your code and check in a partial solution under the assignment submission section**
- **You must submit your assignment submission by 9.30am Monday morning - before the stand-up.**


### Learning objective
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- To write Unit tests with Jasmine
- To write Acceptance tests with Jasmine-jQuery
- To add HTML elements and get user data
- To modify the DOM using jQuery
- To deploy your code using GH-Pages


For the web interface there is this User story

```
As an individual
So that I can check a number when playing FizzBuzz
I would like to be able to enter a number in an field, click a button and see
the output according to the FizzBuzz rules.
```

### Tasks

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### TODO:

- Have a look at the [karma-jquery-jasmine_boilerplate](https://github.com/CraftAcademy/karma-jquery-jasmine_boilerplate) and follow the set up instructions.
- Use the code in the Karma-jQuery-Jasmine-Boilerplate but **set the project and repository name to `fizz_buzz_js`**.
- Write your specs and implementation for the Fizz Buzz game as you did in the initial Ruby challenge - but in JavaScript
- Be smart about using Git: commit and push often. Use feature branches.
- Submit your work in using the assignment section in this chapter. 

#### Review and reflect
Compare this implementation to the Ruby version we wrote a while back during the prep-course. 

1. What are the similarities/differences between the Ruby and js versions?
2. How do you find unit testing with Jasmine in comparison to RSpec? 
3. How can you "gamify" Fizz Buzz? Consider the User Interface/Experience. Can the game be played by multiple players? What about mobile devices? 


### What we are looking for

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### I'm hoping to see that:
- You can use the Jasmine testing framework for both Unit as well as Acceptance tests.
- You understand how to modify DOM elements using jQuery.
- I can track your work by following you commit history - so please commit as soon you are done with a feature or when you have made a test pass.

#### On your repository, I'm hoping to see:
- That you know how to set up and configure 3rd party services for Continuous Integration and test coverage metrics (TravisCI and Coveralls).
- That you are testing the right thing in the right spec file.
- That all tests passing - green is good!
- High test coverage (above 95% is accepted)
- The code is easy to follow: specs are well described, variable names are easy to understand, functions are short, code is nicely formatted, etc.
- The README.md includes relevant information about your solution

**Happy coding!**
