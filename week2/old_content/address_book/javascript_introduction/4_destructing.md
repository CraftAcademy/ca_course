**Destructuring** is a new feature in ES6 where we are given the ability to to extract data from object and arrays and set them with new variables.

And why should we want to do that in the first place?

Well because:

-   It cleans up the code
    
-   It gives an easier syntax for extracting elements from an array or a hash
    
-   Extract data from arrays and objects and assign them to distinct variables with fewer lines of code.
    
Letâ€™s see how it works!
