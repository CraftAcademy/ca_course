## npm & NodeJS

`npm`, short for Node Package Manager, is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management. 

`npm` is pre-installed with Node. ** *We will not be covering NodeJS in this chapter or using it in this course. It is a popular Javascript framework for back-end development. We are just using it here to access some of its tools. * **

If you have Node, you already have npm! If not, install Node - it's as easy as downloading and then running an installer.

Visit the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) website and download the installer.

Once your download is completed, run the installer and follow that instructions.

You can check your version by going to your terminal and typing in this command 
```bash
$ node -v
```

Now you are ready to start using `npm`. You can find more documentation about packages on the [NPM website](https://www.npmjs.com/npm/open-source).
