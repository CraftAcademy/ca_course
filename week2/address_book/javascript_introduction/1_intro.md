Javascript is one of the most commonly used languages in the web development industry.

Javascript (JS for short) is not to be confused with the “Java Programming Language”

  

Both Java and JS share the name Java and are programming languages but that is how far the similarities go. Java is mostly used for backend programming and JS is used mostly for front-end development, even though nowadays you can program in the backend with JS using Node.js. We will talk more about node.js later in the boot camp.

As a full-stack web developer JS is a must have in your toolbox.
  
In summary, do not confuse Java and Javascript and don’t call Javascript Java for short, or all cool programmers will laugh at you and you will bow your head in shame.

You have worked through JavaScript in the prep-course and this section is a short recap of the some of the core concepts. This week we continue our journey with the Javascript programming language.


We introduce you to some of the latest features of the language. During this week, we will build an Address Book application using Javascript APIs to manipulate content on the page, but also persist in the data that we process in the browser.
