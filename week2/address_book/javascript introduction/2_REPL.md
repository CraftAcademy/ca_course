### What is REPL?

A **Read–Eval–Print Loop** (**REPL**), also known as an **interactive top-level** or **language shell**, is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs (i.e. single expressions, evaluates them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise. The term is most usually used to refer to programming interfaces similar to the classic Lisp machine interactive environment. Common examples include command-line shells and similar environments for programming languages and is particularly characteristic of scripting languages.

REPLs facilitate exploratory programming and debugging because the programmer can inspect the printed result before deciding what expression to provide for the next read. The read–eval–print loop involves the programmer more frequently than the classic edit-compile-run-debug cycle. This makes it easier for us and gives us immediate feedback if we have any errors in our code. 

In the following sections, we will use a tool called [repl.it](https://repl.it/) we can add code directly to the section and press run and we will get an output directly in the section.
