We've recently been contacted by a client, who would like us to build an address book so that they can manage their contacts. Some of the features requested by the client include:

* Ability to add new contacts
* View a list of existing contacts
* Update existing contacts
* Delete some contacts
* An appealing design that allows ease of navigation

The team got together with the client in a design sprint and came up with the following user stories related to the above-mentioned features.

#### Create a new contact

```text
As a user
In order to stay in touch with my friends
I would like to be able to create a contact for them in my address book
```

#### List contacts

```text
As a user
In order to contact my friends
I would like to be able to view a list of my saved contacts
```

#### Update existing contacts

```text
As a user
In order to keep my friends' contact details accurate
I would like to be able to update them when needed
```

#### Delete existing contacts

```text
As a user
In order to maintain my contact list up to date
I would like to be able to delete contacts
```



### Technology Stack

Also as part of the design sprint sessions, the team has decided to make this a web-based application. This means the user would need to access this from a browser. The application will consist of a user interface built with HTML with a sprinkle of CSS to make it look good. The logic will be written using pure Javascript with no additional libraries.

In addition to that, we would like to have some acceptance tests \(also known as end-to-end testing\) done while building this application.

You will be part of the team responsible for designing and developing this application. In the next section, we will walk you through the main components that we'll be using as part of the tech stack for this application.
