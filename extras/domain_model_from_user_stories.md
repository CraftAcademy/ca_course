## Domain Model & User stories
A user story is a brief ordinary language description of what a user wants to achieve when using our application. A basic concept is that every story should fit on a post-it note. 

User stories are written by or for the client and as the client's main method of describing their demands and influence the development of the software/system/site.

User stories are a quick way to manage requirements definition without having to create formal specifications and administrative overhead to keep them updated. User stories can also be written by developers to describe non-functional requirements (security, performance, etc.)

### Acceptance Criteria - Definition of 'done'
Before a user story is implemented, its acceptance criteria should be defined to ensure that the objectives of the user story met.

###Format
*“As a < specific user/persona/role >” I want < desired feature/issue that needs to be solved >, so that < benefit from implementing the feature >” + Acceptance Criteria*
