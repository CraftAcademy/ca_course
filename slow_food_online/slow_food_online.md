## NewsRoom Challenge

This Week Lab, we'll be returning to the exciting and complex world of News Publications and build a fully featured news plattform.

This challenge will differ a bit from the previous ones in the curriculum. We will simulate a real project and go over the entire process of a Design Sprint first, before we start writing our implementation.

### Learning Objectives

* Learn about Agile methodologies \(Scrum + XP - Software Craftsmanship\)
* Practice project collaboration - planning, organizing ideas and tasks, capturing requirements
* Anvanced project collaboration like onboarding new team members and joining a new team
* Practice more advanced strategies for  CI, CD and DevOps
* Practice more advanced rails concepts like Action Mailer, Active Storage, ActiveJob.

This week we'll be going over a lot of concepts in form of demos and mod programming sessions. This is what the Bootcamp is all about - learning while solving real-life problems. The pressure will be high, as we introduce a lot of new technologies and strategis to build engaging features, but also in terms of project, management and team collaboration. 

When you’re building your system, you’d probably be thinking a lot about features and making sure it’s not full of bugs. Do NOT forget about the UX, a vastly important part of every web based application these days — and one that i sometimes overlooked.  It often makes the difference between a failure and a success of your app.

Here are some pointers identified as must-haves by many UX developers:

* Frictionless signups
* Focus on your target audience
* Simple onboarding
* Very easy-to-use UI
* Personable
* Appealing design
