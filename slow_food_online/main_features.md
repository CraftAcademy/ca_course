## Main features

Build an End-to-end news creation, production, curation, distribution and publishing platform for localized news.

#### Location

We want the system to be used in editions based on geographical locations. News can appear in one or several editions, depending on their validity for readers \(location, language, etc\). 

#### Categories - Sections

News should belong to a category \(i. e. Sports, Politics, Economy, World, Entertainment, etc\).

#### Authors

Every news article can be attributed to one ore several authors/journalists

#### Rating

Every news article can be rated using rating system \(1 - 5\) with a possibility to add an optional comment.

#### Monetization

\(This part, related to the business side, is to be decided by each team without much guidance from the coaches. Please be prepared to argument your decisions\)

* The publication could implement restrictions to non-subscribing readers.
* Readers can opt in for a 6 or 12 months subscription.
* Revenues can come from sales of ads

#### Administration/moderation

Each news article will be written by an Author/Jounalist and need to be approved by the Editor/Pubicist before being published at a specific date. 

If the publication is running ads, they also need to be moderated and approved. 

#### Multiple language support

The Media company that is our simulated client, operates on several markets and would like the platform to be able to support multi language support. This means that ever news article should be tagged with a language attribute and filtered thereafter. The entire UI should also be translated into at least 2 languages. 

#### User roles

The platform should support multiple user roles that are authorized to perform different actions. Some suggestions are:

**Editor/Publicist** - Can perform all CRUD actions on all objects in the system

**Journalist** - Can create news articles with associated objects \(see below\)

**Subscriber** - Can place orders and add rating to Restaurants
