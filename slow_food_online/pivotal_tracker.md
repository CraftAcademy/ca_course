Pivotal Tracker is a straightforward project planning tool that allows teams to collaborate and react instantly to real-world changes. Itâ€™s based on agile software development methods, but it can be used on a variety of projects. Tracker frees you up to focus on getting things done, without getting bogged down, keeping your plans in sync with reality.

Pivotal Tracker allows you to describe each feature, chore or bug in a very detailed way and fully supports the agile methods we use in our project simulations. Here is an example of a feature with a user story, acceptance criteria, complexity points, etc.

**Remember, the tool you use can support your workflow but it won't do the job for you. You need to add the content and work with maintaining it actively.**
