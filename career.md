## The Endgame - Getting a job

### Perfect your GitHub Profile

Revisit all your repos to ensure you've implemented best practices in your code. Commenting, indenting, and including a README's are 3 easy ways to set yourself apart

A well organized and structured GitHub Profile is a great tool in the process of securing an interview. Make sure you can walk an employer through each repo/project just in case.

### Build your Portfolio

Students should challenge themselves to build a portfolio showcasing their skills, personalities, and writing ability as soon as they can while in class.
Don't wait until the last week of class or after graduation to build your portfolio! Take advantage of the network you have in class as well as your coach to perfect your portfolio.

The portfolio should include at least 2 to 4 projects you've contributed to as well as 1 to 2 projects you've built on your own as your final project in school or as a freelancer.

### Master the interview  
We have a selection of tech interview questions within our curriculum to help you prepare for the interview process and apart from the materials we provide we also encourage all students to include the following items in the preparation process.

### Code, code and then code.

Make sure you code every single day. Breaks for interviews sure, but if you are serious about a job, ensure that you are coding every single day. I might take weekends off to do something completely different, but make sure that you code, code, code.

In order to stay on that coding wagon I would avoid working alone, work in a pair, a team, and on a project that's meaningful to you. Take breaks to prepare for interviews, do tech-tests, research companies and so on, but make sure you have a realistic strategy to ensure you code your heart out until someone starts paying you to do the same.

### Optimizing Your Job Search

Setup your profile on several of the key social networks like LinkedIn (that network is built to help you search for jobs efficiently) and job search websites such as Hired, AngelList and any job board tailored towards the industry and/or your location.

### Preparing for an interview
Below is a list of interview questions that you should run through before your upcoming tech interview to get your mind running.

 **This list is by no means exhaustive, and you should be prepared to handle much more complex questions and exercises than these.**

Remember that the best interview questions are open ended and have no definitive answers –  a good interviewer knows this and will be looking for your thought process and problem solving skills, rather than the ‘correct’ answer.

That being said, there are still some straight forward questions that any programmer should be able to answer and discuss.  Many of these questions are relatively simple but being able to explain them in plain english may be more difficult than you think.

Being able to speak to these issues is important, and verbal communication skills are highly indicative of future job performance. However, showing that you can apply and manipulate these concepts is much more difficult than speaking to them in generalities.

To quote Albert Einstein, *‘If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough’*

* [General Personality](self_assessment/general_personality.md)
* [Agile](self_assessment/agile.md)
* [General Ruby questions](self_assessment/general_ruby.md)
* [Advanced Ruby questions](self_assessment/advanced_ruby.md)
* [Databases, ORM's, etc.](self_assessment/databases.md)

**While it’s great to be able to speak to all of these concepts and show that you can carry an in-depth technical conversation, there’s probably nothing more valuable than having a solid portfolio of apps and a demonstrable level of skill.**
