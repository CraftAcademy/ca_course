## Deploy your app

It's time to move your app from the safty of your `localhost` to a server that is actually connected to internet, and make it accessible to the general public. Don't worry if your portfolio is not fully what you hope it to be, the fact that you publish it on the internet does not mean that it will be hit by a massive wave of visitors. We want to do it for learning purposes. 

Do you need a computer set up as a web server and connected to the internet to make our application public? No, you dont. There are plenty of services we can use to deploy our application to the cloud, making use of so called Virtual Servers. One of these services is Netlify. 

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a platform you can use to automatically build, deploy, serve, and manage your frontend sites and web apps. It also provides a variety of other features like form processing, serverless functions, and split testing. 

We will make use of the more advanced functions on Netlify later in the Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp, but for now we will stick to the basic stuff.
