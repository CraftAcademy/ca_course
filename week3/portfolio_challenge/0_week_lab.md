# Week lab

The weekly challenge is an individual one. You are supposed to build an individual portfolio site that will showcase the projects you have been working on. We will leave the visual aspects of the site itself to your artistic ambitions, but we have some requirements as to the functionality we want the site to deliver:

1. Use Middleman as the framework
2. Include a Portfolio section
3. Get data about your past projects from a json file
4. Include a About me section
5. Make use of components for the header and the footer section (at least)
6. Use a css framework (preferably SASS) for styling
7. Deploy your site on GHPages
8. Set up Google Analytics

**Note: You are welcome to work in pairs if you like, but it is not a requirement and if you do, you need to figure out how to complete your individual sites and still be able to pair program.**

## Learning Objectives

* Get to know React
