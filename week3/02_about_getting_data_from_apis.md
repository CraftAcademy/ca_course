# About API's in the context of the Web

API is technically short for "Application Programming Interface", and the term is tossed around in the programming industry so much, the overall complexity of what they are, and how they can make your life easier - or a living hell gets overlooked.

Some definitions:

"a set of programming instructions and standards for accessing a web-based software application or web tool"

"a set of functions and procedures allowing the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service."

"...to provide a way to connect computer software components together"



Some time ago, it became a big thing for web startup to offer public access to some of their internal data through a web service API, typically using REST and JSON, thus allowing third-party developers to integrate with their systems. Web developers started using the term "API" to mean specifically (and only) "publically accessible web service", and misusing it to include the implementation thereof. Okay, we will be working on this a lot moving forward, so today is NOT the day for a deep dive into this concept and becoming experst. Today is the day when we will make use of an API for the first time, and later, we will disect what occured and go over some of the moving parts.
