This was an important week here at Craft Academy, apart from being introduced to Ruby on Rails we have gone through a lot of theoretical concepts.

Let's do a recap and check that you have internalized all that we have covered.

__By now you should have learned:__

- [ ] The structure of a Ruby on Rails application and the different folders. The most important folder is the `app` folder where we will have the bulk of our application.


- [ ] The concept of params, and when and where we use them. Make sure that you understand the different types of param-method, and how they interact with our application.

- [ ] Different routes and how they connect to a controller and an action, the syntax we use when we write routes and the difference between resourceful and non-resourceful routes.

- [ ] The most common helpers for the views and how we use them.

- [ ] What the CRUD acronym stands for and what controller actions are linked to them.

- [ ] What the Model-View-Controller pattern is and how the Ruby on Rails framework is built upon this pattern. Also, make sure that you understand why Rails uses this specific pattern.

- [ ] What DRY and Convention Over Configuration mean and why we follow these conventions when building our application. And when we should not follow Convention Over Configuration.

- [ ] Know how to identify gems and what functionality they provide by reading the code and how to read and use the right documentation.

- [ ] Learn about how to use tests (High-level acceptance tests and Low-level unit tests) to drive the development process and how to add the different testing frameworks to our Rails application.

 - [ ] How to deploy an application and what services we should use in different cases. For example when deploying static pages vs. deploying web applications.

Make sure that you have checked off all of these learning objectives before the weekend ends. This list will help you prepare for the upcoming week and make sure that you don't have large gaps in your knowledge.
