This weekend we want you and your team to continue working on your Slowfood application.

###### However there are a couple of task that you need to complete.

- Add styling to the different parts of your application using Tailwind CSS
- Finish the main functionality of the application
- Prepare for a "Sprint Review" where you and your team will showcase your application and talk through the code.


--- 

During a "Sprint Review" we need you and your team to showcase:

- Your application (it should be deployed)
- Talk about the challenges your team faced and the solutions that you came up with
- If the planning was accurate and if your team executed the plan in the right timeline
- And other questions that may naturally arise when showcasing your application.

We will also have a "Sprint Retrospective" on Monday morning (not to be confused with our regular Camp Retrospectives)

This Sprint Retro will focus on the Slowfood Challenge. 

-   What went well during the Sprint
-   What could be improved
-   What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint
