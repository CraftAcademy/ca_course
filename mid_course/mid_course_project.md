## Mid Course Project

It's Week 6 and that means that you will be putting all your new skills into practice. It's time for the Mid Course Project.

###Objectives
Put all of the skills you  have picked up to use in a group project. 
1. Agile methods for software development
2. Pair Programming
3. Collaboration using Git and GitHub
4. Test- and Behavior Driven Development
5. Third-party services

###Requirements
* Build and deploy a SAAS (Software as as Service) application.
* Implement user authentication and authorization (Devise, CanCanCan)
* Implement OAuth authentication
* Implement some sort of market place functionality (services or products)
* Make use of a payment gateway (PayPal, Klarna, Stripe)
* Make use of the geocoding and maps (Google Maps, OpenStreet Map) for vendors or service providers.
* Implement a rating system (for products, vendors or something else)
* Set up a third party API integration (TraficLab, Facebook, etc) 

###Execution
The MidCourse Project is about execution: planning your work, collaboration as a team, doing the right thing at the right time and always have your priorities straight.

1. How do we start our project? 
2. What is the domain?
3. Do we start with creating a high level description or filling the backlog with user stories and chores. Or both?
2. Shall we make use of LoFi's?
3. What framework shall we use? Rails or Sinatra? Or something else?
4. Who does what and when?
4. Should we have a main repository?

Remember that this is a simulation of a real enterprise project and even if there is a lot of uncertainties in terms of client requirements you can treat this as a project for a start-up. You have the power to make the decisions. The above mentioned requirements are suggestions to make the project an interesting learning experience.

This project will become part of your personal portfolio so don't aim too high but do make sure that there is enough complexity for an reviewer to find the application interesting.
