## Project Schedule

The MidCourse Project is a 7-day task. During this week you need to work as a regular project team and  plan and execute daily stand-ups and project planning meetings on your own. 

###Suggested schedule

Start each day with a stand-up to access each team members progress and to plan your daily activities. 

Assign a team member to be responsible for deployment. That person can have multiple heroku sources on his local repo or, even better, set up Travis (or what have you) to deploy to different servers depending on what branch is being used (you should work on `development` branch. 

End each day with a deploy to a development server and a short demo in a stand up format. Plan the evening's or the next day's activities. 

###Tips and Tricks
1. Create pairs to work on features or assign individual team members to a feature. 
2. Make sure to flag your Waffle issues as a `feature`, `chore` or `bug`
3. Write as many tests as you can. You will be tempted to skip some tests but that will lead to a lot of manual testing that is really inefficient use of your time. 
4. Ask for help. We are here to help you. If there is a feature that you would like to implement but lack knowledge on how, don't hesitate to ask us for help. DO your own research first but don't stay stuck on anything for more than 30 minutes. 
5. Remember that this is a simulation, so play pretend. This week can mean a lot of fun if you make a bit of a theatratical game out of it. ;-)
6. Remember that there is NO project that does not include some level of chaos. If you think that all professional projects runs smoothly, forget about that. Remember everything we have thought you and make use of it this week and you'll be fine!

###Feature descriptions - User stories

| Field               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Description         | For user stories, provide enough detail for estimating how much work will be required to implement the story. Focus on who the feature is for, what users want to accomplish, and why. Don't describe how the feature should be developed. Do provide sufficient details so that your team can write tasks and test cases to implement the item.                                                                                                                                             |
| Acceptance Criteria | Provide the criteria to be met before the bug or user story can be closed. <br>Before work begins, describe the customer acceptance criteria as clearly as possible. Conversations between the team and customers to define the acceptance criteria will help ensure that your team understands your customers' expectations. The acceptance criteria can be used as the basis for acceptance tests so that you can more effectively evaluate whether an item has been satisfactorily completed. |
| Value area          | The area of customer value addressed by the epic, feature, requirement, or backlog item. Values include: <br><strong>Architectural:</strong> Technical services to implement business features that deliver solution <br><strong>Business:</strong> Services that fulfill customers or stakeholder needs that directly deliver customer value to support the business (Default)                                                                                                                                                       |
| Story Points        | Estimate the amount of work required to complete a user story using any unit of measurement your team prefers, such as t-shirt size, story points, or time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Priority            | A subjective rating of the user story, feature, or requirement as it relates to the business. Allowed values are <br>1. Product cannot ship without the feature. <br>2: Product cannot ship without the feature, but it doesn't have to be addressed immediately. <br>3: Implementation of the feature is optional based on resources, time, and risk.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Risk                | A subjective rating of the relative uncertainty around the successful completion of a user story. Allowed values are:   <br>1 - High <br>2 - Medium <br>3 - Low                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
