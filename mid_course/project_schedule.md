## Project Schedule

The MidCourse Project is a 7-day task. During this week you need to work as a regular project team and  plan and execute daily stand-ups and project planning meetings on your own. 

###Suggested schedule

Start each day with a stand-up to access each team members progress and to plan your daily activities. 

Assign a team member to be responsible for deployment. That person can have multiple heroku sources on his local repo or, even better, set up Travis (or what have you) to deploy to different servers depending on what branch is being used (you should work on `development` branch. 

End each day with a deploy to a development server and a short demo in a stand up format. Plan the evening's or the next day's activities. 

1. Create pairs to work on features or assign individual team members to a feature. 
2. Make sure to flag your Waffle issues as a `feature`, `chore` or `bug`
3. Write as many tests as you can. You will be tempted to skip some tests but that will lead to a lot of manual testing that is really inefficient use of your time. 
4. Ask for help. We are here to help you. If there is a feature that you would like to implement but lack knowledge on how, don't hesitate to ask us for help. DO your own research first but don't stay stuck on anything for more than 30 minutes. 
5. Remember that this is a simulation, so play pretend. This week can mean a lot of fun if you make a bit of a theatratical game out of it. ;-)
