The last step now is to create a Pull Request to the Craft Academy repo. 
This is the same repo that you originally forked from. 

The "PR" short for Pull Request functions as a way to inspect, ask questions and review the code. The PRs are an industry standard when multiple people are working on the same project. 
You are in essence asking them for your code to be merged to the codebase where it was originally forked from. 

> *The primary way we at Craft Academy give feedback on your code is through the PRs.*

Please follow the [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to create a PR

When you come to `step 6` in the guide please use the template below.  Note that the PR template includes more information then we need for this particular challenge, so replace the content with your PR-description.
